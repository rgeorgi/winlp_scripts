<p>Dear {name},</p>

<P>Thank you for participating in WiNLP 2019. We have reviewed your receipts and have cleared your reimbursement in the amount of USD <b style="color:#10a41b">${total_amt:.2f}.</b></P>

<P>This includes ${reg_amt:.2f} for registration and/or ACL membership, and ${other_amt:.2f} for other costs.</P>

<P>We apologize for the additional request for information, but if you could fill out one more form with your payment information, this will help us in sending out reimbursements as soon as possible.</P>

<P>The preferred methods of payment are, in order:</P>
<ol>
    <li>Venmo/Paypal</li>
    <li>USD Cheque</li>
    <li>Wire Transfer</li>
</ol>

<p>ACL-related fees will be refunded to your payment method if you paid online, otherwise this will be included in your direct payment. If fees are assessed for a check or transfer, these will be included in your reimbursement.</p>
