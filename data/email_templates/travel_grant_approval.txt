Dear {name},

    We have reviewed your request for travel assistance, and are currently able to offer you up to ${amount} USD, which consists of:

    * $62 USD/night of stay, up to 7 nights
    * Airfare to either Florence (FLR), Bologna (BLQ), Milan, or Rome. Train connections can be made in <3 hours and for < 50 EUR.

Though we raised more funds this year, registration and flights are more expensive than last year, so we are making an effort to keep costs down. Please under-spend if you can, and let us know your exact airfare costs as soon as you can. This will allow us to extend aid to as many authors as possible.

We cannot cover registrations at the moment, but please do register by Jun 28 to get reduced-rate early-bird. Contact us immediately if this is a deal-breaking hardship.
