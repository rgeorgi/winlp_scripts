Dear {mentee_name} and {mentor_name},

    We are happy that you will be joining us in the WiNLP mentorship program at ACL in the coming days!

    After reviewing our responses to the mentorship program form, we have made the following assignment:

    Mentor: {mentor_name:>25} {mentor_pronouns:<18} {mentor_email}
    Mentee: {mentee_name:>25} {mentee_pronouns:<18} {mentee_email}

    Please use the contact information provided in this email to get in touch with each other, schedule a time to meet, and briefly introduce yourself and your interests.

    To help schedule a meeting, here is the availability that you both reported using our form:

Please let us know if any of your plans have changed, or if you are unable to find a suitable schedule and we will see if we can find another match.

Sincerely,
WiNLP 2019 Co-Chairs
